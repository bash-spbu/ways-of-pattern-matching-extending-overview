# OCaml pattern matching extensions overview

This repository contains an exhaustive overview, which

- describes the current state of the OCaml pattern matching support;
- shows which opportinuties can be supported further and which parts of the language can be modified/extended in order to do it;
- introduces several objective criterions with help of which different designs can be compared to each other;
- discusses one of the design variant as an example;
- suggests one more extremely lightweight and composable design.

This is a supplementary document which is to help the OCaml community create the real concise RFC of pattern matching language extension with the biggest ratio of power & flexibility TO implementation complexity & language modification size.
